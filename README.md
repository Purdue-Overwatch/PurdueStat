# PurdueStat - Easily analyze your Overwatch scrims

## Introduction

TODO: intro

If you've played on a competitive Overwatch team since 2020, you're probably familiar with OverStat. If you aren't, OverStat was a free workshop tool created by [Matrix](https://www.adunna.me) that you could use to export scrim stats into log files via the Overwatch Workshop. These files could then be uploaded to the [website](https://www.overstat.us), which would convert the data to a human-readable format, allowing teams to access and analyze scrim statistics like never before. Unfortunately, Matrix announced that OverStat would no longer be recieving any updates in late 2021.

When we heard this, we decided we wanted to try creating our own version of OverStat. Although we wrote every line of code from scratch, we have taken an incredible amount of inspiration from the original OverStat and we want to give credit where credit is due. Matrix has been super helpful and helped us out in the beginning when we weren't super sure how to approach the project.

### TODO: Meet the team

## Development

As full time students, our priority is, has been, and will always be our education. This means that development on PurdueStat does not (and likely will never) have a regular schedule.

That being said, we recognize that the Overwatch community is full of brilliant people, and we encourage you to create pull requests if you'd like to contribute! For major updates, please open an issue first to explain the changes you'd like to make.

Submitting a pull request does not guarantee it will be merged, and we reserve the right to reject any request without explanation.
