# PurdueStat - Easily analyze your Overwatch scrims

## Introduction

If you've played on a competitive Overwatch team since 2020, you're probably familiar with OverStat. If you aren't, OverStat was a free workshop tool created by [Matrix](https://www.adunna.me) that you could use to export scrim stats into log files via the Overwatch Workshop. These files could then be uploaded to the [website](https://www.overstat.us), which would convert the data to a human-readable format, allowing teams to access and analyze scrim statistics like never before. Matrix announced that OverStat would no longer be recieving any more updates in late 2021. As the Purdue Overwatch Club relied heavily on OverStat to host scrims and analyze data, we decided to try making our own version. 

## Meet the team

Everyone on the PurdueStat team is a full time student at Purdue University, brought together by the Purdue University Overwatch Club. 

- Josh Park (joshpark8): Hi! I'm Josh, and I am one of the founding members of PurdueStat. I'm a second-year student at Purdue studying Math and CS. I was previously a team captain for the Purdue Overwatch Club, leading my team to a conference championship and third place at nationals. I also served as the president of the Purdue Overwatch Club for around a year, but I surrendered my position to work at Sub-Zero Group Inc. as a Software QA Co-op, where I am now. When I am at Purdue, I work as an Application Support Developer at Purdue's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing. If you'd like to learn more about me or get in touch, you can find my resume and links to my social media on my [website](https://www.joshpark.dev/)!

## Development

As full time students, our priority is, has been, and will always be our education. This means that development on PurdueStat does not (and likely will never) have a regular schedule.

That being said, we recognize that the Overwatch community is full of brilliant people, and pull requests are welcome! Please check `Contributing.md` for more details if you are interested!

## Credits

Of course, we'd like to give credit to Matrix for the idea! Without OverStat, this project would never have been possible. We are also very grateful for the guidance that he provided us in the early stages of development. He helped us visualize how we should strucutre the project and provided valuable insight that allowed us to get off the ground and make significant progress.
